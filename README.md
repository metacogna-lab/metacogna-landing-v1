# Run and deploy your AI Studio app
[Contributor guide → `AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

Metacogna Lab partners with operators who need clear situational awareness across AI initiatives. This landing experience demonstrates how we choreograph executive dashboards, project galleries, and decision logs into a single narrative so prospective partners can glimpse the command center we will build for them. Every screen emphasizes clarity, accountability, and trustworthy automation instead of raw technical flash.

## Experience Overview
- Story-driven hero, methodology, and services sections explain our engagement model without overwhelming stakeholders.
- Embedded portal preview highlights real-time decisions, pipelines, and project states so leadership can imagine their own workspace.
- Contact, login, and HubSpot integrations keep outreach seamless while we maintain a handcrafted brand system.

## Mission & Outcomes
- Translate complex AI programs into action plans business teams can navigate confidently.
- Anchor every deliverable to measurable value: faster approvals, clearer governance, and durable institutional knowledge.
- Build with privacy-respecting defaults and feature flags (`VITE_ENABLE_*`) so each deployment matches the client’s risk posture.
